# TestProject


Step 1:
 a. Make S3 bucket in your region named "employee-eu-west-1" for the CodeRepository. Later on this bucket will be used for CI/CD pipeline using CodePipeline & CodeDeploy. 
 b. Create folders under "employee-eu-west-1" bucket named "WebSite"
 c. Upload the all the files from employee-eu-west-1/WebSite to the S3 bucket under the path "employee-eu-west-1/WebSite". 

The code will be copied to the S3-static-website bucket, by cloud-formation template "staticwebsite_emp_with_ACM_cloudfront.yaml"
 
Step 2:
 Build Infrastructure using cloudformation template "staticwebsite_emp_with_ACM_cloudfront.yaml".
This CF template will build s3 website with cloudfront and certificates generated by ACM.
